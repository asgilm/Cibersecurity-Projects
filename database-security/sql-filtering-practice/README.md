## 💻 Scenario
As a cybersecurity analyst, I created and applied SQL filters to:
- Identify failed login attempts outside business hours
- Retrieve login activity on specific dates
- Find login attempts outside of Mexico
- List employees in specific departments or offices
- Filter out employees not in IT for targeted updates

These queries help the organization detect unusual login behavior and update employee devices as needed.

## 🛠️ Tools & Methods
- MariaDB
- SQL queries with `WHERE`, `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, and `LIKE` operators
