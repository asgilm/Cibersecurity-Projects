## üíª Scenario
As a cybersecurity analyst for a multimedia company offering web design, graphic design, and social media marketing services, I investigated an ICMP flood DDoS attack that caused a two-hour network outage.

The incident was traced to a misconfigured firewall, which allowed an attacker to overwhelm the network with ping (ICMP) traffic. The incident response team mitigated the attack by blocking incoming ICMP packets, isolating non-critical services, and restoring critical network services.
